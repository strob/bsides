== Installation

MEAPSoft[2] is used for audio analysis;
place the ``MEAPsoft-2.0.beta'' into a ``lib'' directory.

Numm[3] is also required for many scripts.



[1] the term may be inaccessible to our younger readers*; ``cassette''
    refers to a pocket-sized cartridge containing two-sided magnetic
    plastic tape on which an audio signal may be serialized.
